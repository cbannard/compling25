then stepped on one side, and pointing to the door of the room, she said, letting her visitor pass in front of her:  “Step in, my good sir', '”  The little room into which the young man walked, with yellow paper on the walls, geraniums and muslin curtains in the windows, was brightly lighted up at that moment by the setting sun', '  “So the sun will shine like this _then_ too!” flashed as it were by chance through Raskolnikov’s mind, and with a rapid glance he scanned everything in the room, trying as far as possible to notice and remember its arrangement', ' But there was nothing special in the room', ' The furniture, all very old and of yellow wood, consisted of a sofa with a huge bent wooden back, an oval table in front of the sofa, a dressing-table with a looking-glass fixed on it between the windows, chairs along the walls and two or three half-penny prints in yellow frames, representing German damsels with birds in their hands--that was all', ' In the corner a light was burning before a small ikon', ' Everything was very clean; the floor and the furniture were brightly polished; everything shone', '  “Lizaveta’s work,” thought the young man', ' There was not a speck of dust to be seen in the whole flat', '  “It’s in the houses of spiteful old widows that one finds such cleanliness,” Raskolnikov thought again, and he stole a curious glance at the cotton curtain over the door leading into another tiny room, in which stood the old woman’s bed and chest of drawers and into which he had never looked before', ' These two rooms made up the whole flat', '  “What do you want?” the old woman said severely, coming into the room and, as before, standing in front of him so as to look him straight in the face', '  “I’ve brought something to pawn here,” and he drew out of his pocket an old-fashioned flat silver watch, on the back of which was engraved a globe; the chain was of steel', '  “But the time is up for your last pledge', ' The month was up the day before yesterday', '”  “I will bring you the interest for another month; wait a little', '”  “But that’s for me to do as I please, my good sir, to wait or to sell your pledge at once', '”  “How much will you give me for the watch, Alyona Ivanovna?”  “You come with such trifles, my good sir, it’s scarcely worth anything', ' I gave you two roubles last time for your ring and one could buy it quite new at a jeweler’s for a rouble and a half', '”  “Give me four roubles for it, I shall redeem it, it was my father’s', ' I shall be getting some money soon', '”  “A rouble and a half, and interest in advance, if you like!”  “A rouble and a half!” cried the young man', '  “Please yourself”--and the old woman handed him back the watch', ' The young man took it, and was so angry that he was on the point of going away; but checked himself at once, remembering that there was nowhere else he could go, and that he had had another object also in coming', '  “Hand it over,” he said roughly', '  The old woman fumbled in her pocket for her keys, and disappeared behind the curtain into the other room', ' The young man, left standing alone in the middle of the room, listened inquisitively, thinking', ' He could hear her unlocking the chest of drawers', '  “It must be the top drawer,” he reflected', ' “So she carries the keys in a pocket on the right', ' All in one bunch on a steel ring', '', '', '', ' And there’s one key there, three times as big as all the others, with deep notches;
